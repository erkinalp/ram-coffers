"""Splitting planner: a DeepSeek MoE checkpoint across a heterogeneous fleet.

The PS3 port of this idea had one placement axis, because a 256 MB console can
hold exactly one thing: **one expert per console**. A ninth-generation console
holds 8-13 GiB, which is enough for a whole layer's hot weights *and* a few
dozen routed experts, so the interesting question stops being "does it fit" and
becomes "what belongs where". This module answers it along four axes at once:

1. **Pipeline, by contiguous layer range.** A stage owns consecutive decoder
   layers so a token crosses the network once per stage, carrying one residual
   state (56 KiB at V4-Pro width in bf16, four times hidden because of its
   hyper-connections) rather than anything proportional to the weights.
   Gigabit ethernet is the fleet's scarcest resource and this is the axis that
   respects it.

2. **Hot/cold, by coffer.** Everything an MoE layer reads for *every* token —
   attention, the router, the shared expert, the norms — is small
   (~330 MiB at V4-Pro width) and must sit in the fastest coffer the owning
   console has. The routed experts are ~12.9 GiB per layer and are read a handful
   at a time, so they belong in slow coffers and on NVMe. This is the RAM
   Coffers thesis applied to a memory hierarchy the console vendors built for
   their own reasons: the Series X's 560/336 GB/s split is a hot/cold boundary
   already drawn in silicon.

3. **Expert-parallel, within a stage.** A layer's routed experts are spread over
   the stage's consoles in proportion to what each can hold *and* how fast it
   can read, so a Series S and a Series X in the same stage finish their share
   of a token at the same time instead of the small one stalling the group.

4. **SSD streaming, as the overflow tier.** These consoles have 2.4-5.5 GB/s
   NVMe, which is the one respect in which they beat a commodity desktop. An
   expert that does not fit in RAM is not a planning failure; it is a resident
   of the cold tier, streamed on a routing hit, and the plan reports what that
   costs.

The load-balancing rule (axis 3) and the hot/cold rule (axis 2) are borrowed
directly from what works for DeepSeek on consumer hardware: KTransformers and
Fiddler both keep attention and the popular experts on the fast device and push
the long tail to the slow one, partitioning by arithmetic intensity rather than
by parameter count; llama.cpp's ``-ot`` expert-offload does the same thing by
hand. The difference here is that the "fast device" and the "slow device" are two
coffers of the same console, and there are dozens of consoles.

The planner is pure arithmetic. It never touches a console, so a fleet can be
sized, rebalanced, and argued about from a laptop, and the same plan is what the
deployment tools turn into a ``cluster.json``.
