"""DeepSeek MoE inference across ninth-generation console hardware.

A fleet of PlayStation 5s, Xbox Series X/S consoles, and the salvage boards
built from the same silicon (AMD 4700S/4800S, BC-250), running one DeepSeek
model between them under the RAM Coffers memory-tier model.

The pieces, in the order they are used:

``hardware``    console SKUs, per-unit downbinning, memory coffers, backends
``model``       DeepSeek profiles and the sizes derived from them
``planner``     what goes on which console, and what that should cost
``protocol``    the G9XC wire format
``transport``   persistent multiplexed connections
``node``        the console-side worker
``dispatch``    per-layer expert fan-out and reduction
``coordinator`` shelf and fleet drivers
``inventory``   fleet files, probing, and plan/config generation
