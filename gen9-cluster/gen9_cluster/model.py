"""DeepSeek model profiles: what the planner needs to know about a checkpoint.

A DeepSeek decoder splits across consoles according to four properties, and they
pull in different directions:

1. **Compressed attention.** V3 uses MLA, which squeezes the KV cache into one
   ``kv_lora_rank``-wide latent plus a decoupled RoPE key per token. V4 replaces
   it with a *hybrid* of CSA and HCA (:class:`HybridAttentionConfig`), which
   compresses along the sequence instead: every ``m`` tokens become one cache
   entry. Either way the cache is small enough that a 16 GB console can host
   attention, and either way the block's own weights are read for every token,
   so they belong in a fast coffer.
2. **DeepSeekMoE** puts many narrow routed experts plus one always-on shared
   expert in each MoE layer. Only ``top_k`` of the routed experts run per token,
   so the routed weights are enormous but cold — exactly what a bandwidth-tiered
   coffer hierarchy and an NVMe are for.
3. **Mixed-precision weights.** V3 is FP8 (E4M3) throughout. V4 keeps FP8 for
   everything read every token and drops the *expert* weights to MXFP4, which is
   where nearly all the bytes are: it roughly halves what a fleet has to hold.
   :class:`QuantSpec` carries the format and its block scales, so the packed
   size — the thing the planner actually reasons about — follows from the
   checkpoint's own quantisation config rather than from a guess.
4. **Residual width.** V4's manifold-constrained hyper-connections widen the
   residual stream to ``hc_mult`` × hidden while the layer input stays hidden-
   wide. The layer does not get more expensive, but a *pipeline boundary* does:
   what crosses between shelves is the whole residual state, so a shelf hop
   carries ``hc_mult`` times the activation it would in V3.

Sizes here are computed from the architecture, not read off a file listing, so a
profile can be edited (or a new one declared) and every derived number follows.
Each profile's :meth:`ModelProfile.total_params` is checked against the published
parameter count in the tests, which is what makes it safe to trust the derived
byte counts.

    V4 gave every layer its own compressed stream. CSA2 instead keeps a small
    number of shared pools: a layer listed in ``kv_source_layers`` appends
    main-KV entries to its stream, a layer in ``index_source_layers`` appends

    it never writes a stream of its own.

    Two properties matter to the planner:

    - The whole model's growing KV cache lives on the few shelf hosts that own
      a source layer, not spread one stream per layer — at a million tokens
      the derived figure is ~864 B/token against the card's ~890 (a ~3%

    - Later decoder indexers are confined to the candidate pool built by

      ``candidate_block_size`` entries — so their scan cost is bounded
      independently of context length, unlike an encoder-side scan.
