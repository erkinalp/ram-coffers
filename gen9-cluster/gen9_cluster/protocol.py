"""G9XC: the wire format between a shelf coordinator and its consoles.

Adapted from the PS3 port's P3XC, with the changes ninth-generation hardware
forces:

* **A console holds many experts, not one.** P3XC could put the expert id in the
  header because a PS3 held exactly one. Here a node holds dozens, and a token
  routing into three of them must not cost three round trips — so
  :class:`ExpertBatchPayload` names a *set* of experts and their gate weights in
  one frame. That single change is what keeps the per-layer latency at one round
  trip per console instead of one per expert.
* **The reply is per-expert rows, not a partial sum.** This is P3XC's rule kept,
  not dropped: a node returns one weighted row per expert, tagged with the
  expert it came from (:class:`ExpertRowsPayload`), and the coordinator adds
  them in strict top-k order. Collapsing a console's experts into one fp32 sum
  re-associates the addition, so the same token would produce different logits
  depending on which console happened to hold which expert — a replan would
  silently change the output. ``Flags.FAST`` asks for the collapsed sum anyway,
  for a caller that has decided it wants the bandwidth back; it is opt-in
  precisely because it is the answer-changing choice.
* **Weights are FP8 with block scales.** The dtype field therefore has to name
  ``fp8-e4m3-b128``, and a frame carrying it also carries its scale block, so a
  shard can be shipped in the format the checkpoint already uses.
* **Little-endian.** P3XC was big-endian because the Cell's PPE was. Every
  console here is x86-64, so the wire order is the host order and encoding is a
  memcpy on both ends.

The framing is deliberately dull: a fixed 32-byte header, then the payload.
Fixed-size headers mean a node can read a header, learn the payload length, and
read exactly that — no delimiter scanning, no partial-parse states to get wrong
at three in the morning when a shelf is wedged.

Every frame carries ``request_id``, and a reply must echo it. The transport
matches replies to requests by that id alone, which is what allows several
requests to be in flight on one connection: at 92 blocks per token and a quarter
of a millisecond per hop, a strictly serial connection would spend most of a
token's time waiting.

``request_id`` is a *transport* id, scoped to one connection and reallocated on
reconnect, so it cannot identify a retried batch. A batch that wants
exactly-once execution carries its own 64-bit ``batch_id`` in the payload; the
node runs it under that id and replays the first attempt's bytes to a retry
(:mod:`gen9_cluster.dedup`).
