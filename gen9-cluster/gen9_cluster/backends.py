"""Binding the console-side kernels to the node worker.

The node calls one thing — an :class:`~gen9_cluster.node.ExpertRunner` — and this
module decides what is behind it. Selection is by what is actually installed on
*this* console, not by what the inventory file claims, because the inventory is
written by a human and the console is the authority on its own libraries.

Order of preference on a given console:

1. ``libgen9_cpu.so`` if it built here (AVX2, and on Zen 2 that is the ceiling).
2. numpy, which is correct, portable, and slow enough that it should only ever
   be a bring-up path.

The GPU backends are deliberately *not* auto-selected. A Vulkan or HIP runner
needs a device, a queue, a compiled pipeline, and a memory allocation strategy
that outlives a single call; wiring that up belongs to the node's startup, and
guessing at it here would produce a fleet where some consoles silently fell back
to the CPU and nobody noticed until the plan's estimates stopped matching
reality. :func:`describe_backends` reports what is available so a deployment can
fail loudly instead.
